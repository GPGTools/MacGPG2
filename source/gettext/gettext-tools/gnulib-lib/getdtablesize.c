         are 0..N-1.  It can be obtained through a loop as follows:
           {
             int fd;
             for (fd = 3; fd < 65536; fd++)

             return fd;
           }
         On Windows XP, the result is 2048.
         The drawback of this loop is that it allocates memory for a libc
         internal array that is never freed.

         The number N can also be obtained as the upper bound for
         _getmaxstdio ().  _getmaxstdio () returns the maximum number of open
         FILE objects.  The sanity check in _setmaxstdio reveals the maximum
         number of file descriptors.  This too allocates memory, but it is
         freed when we call _setmaxstdio with the original value.  */

      dtablesize = bound;
