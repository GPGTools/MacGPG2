=head1 NAME

B<pth-config> - Pth library build utility

=head1 VERSION

GNU Pth PTH_VERSION_STR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pth-config>
[B<--help>]
[B<--version>]
[B<--all>]
[B<--prefix>]
[B<--exec-prefix>]
[B<--bindir>]
[B<--libdir>]
[B<--includedir>]
[B<--mandir>]
[B<--datadir>]
[B<--acdir>]
[B<--cflags>]
[B<--ldflags>]
[B<--libs>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pth-config> program is a little helper utility for easy configuring and
building applications based on the pth(3) library.  It can be used to query the
C compiler and linker flags which are required to correctly compile and link
the application against the pth(3) library.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<pth-config> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Prints the short usage information.

=item B<--version>

Prints the version number and date of the installed pth(3) library.

=item B<--all>

Forces the output of all flags, that is, including extra flags which are not
B<Pth> specific.

=item B<--prefix>

Prints the installation prefix of architecture independent files

=item B<--exec-prefix>

Prints the installation prefix of architecture dependent files.

=item B<--bindir>

Prints the installation directory of binaries.

=item B<--libdir>

Prints the installation directory of libraries.

=item B<--includedir>

Prints the installation directory of include headers.

=item B<--mandir>

Prints the installation directory of manual pages.

=item B<--datadir>

Prints the installation directory of shared data.

=item B<--acdir>

Prints the installation directory of B<autoconf> data.

=item B<--cflags>

Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the pth(3)-based
application. The output is usually added to the C<CFLAGS> variable of the
applications C<Makefile>.

=item B<--ldflags>

Prints the linker flags (C<-L>) which are needed to link the application with
the pth(3) library. The output is usually added to the C<LDFLAGS> variable of
the applications C<Makefile>.

=item B<--libs>

Prints the library flags (C<-l>) which are needed to link the application with
the pth(3) library. The output is usually added to the C<LIBS> variable of the
applications C<Makefile>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 CC      = cc
 CFLAGS  = -O `pth-config --cflags`
 LDFLAGS = `pth-config --ldflags`
 LIBS    = -lm `pth-config --libs`

 all: foo
 foo: foo.o
     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
 foo.o: foo.c
     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
