This is the IPC library used by GnuPG 2, GPGME and a few other
packages.

See COPYING.LIB on how to share, modify and distribute the software
itself (LGPLv2.1+) and COPYING for the documentation (GPLv3+).

Please send bug report to the gnupg-devel mailing list or enter them

Notes for Windows CE:
----------------------

Libassuan supports WindowsCE (tested with WindowsMobile 6.5).  To
install it, copy libassuan-0.dll into a location where DLL are found
and install the included gpgcedev driver: First copy "gpgcedev.dll"
into the root directory, second run the included program gpgcemgr on
the device: "gpgcemgr --register".  This creates the necessary
registry keys.  In case the copy step fails, the driver may still be
in use: Close all applications using that driver, run "gpgcemgr
--deactivate" to deactivate the running driver and try again.

Registry keys created by "gpgcemgr --register" are:

   Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\dll    -> "gpgcedev.dll"
   Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\prefix -> "GPG"
   Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\Index  -> 1      (dword)
