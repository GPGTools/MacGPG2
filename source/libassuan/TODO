* More tests.
* Check that we have Pth-ed all blocking fucntions.
* Introduce a spawn wrapper program as gpgme has to not leak fds under W32.
* assuan_transact returns immediately on an error in the callback
  function.  It might be better to return the error to the caller. As
  an example see dirmngr-client, where we need to send empty responses
  for unknown inquiries, albeit dirmngr itself would handle the
  returns for assuan_inquire gracefully.  We need to check all
  applications whether it is safe to change this.
* XOPEN_SOURCE and snprintf
  See Peter O'Gorman's mail.

* W32
** Check what kind of fd we use with inbound.fd etc.
