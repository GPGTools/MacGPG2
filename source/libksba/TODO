* src/dn.c:

** Check that error handling of bad utf-8 encoding is correct
** There is an ambiguity in rfc2253.
This is related to the handling of spaces around delimiters.  At one
place it talks about whitespace and few lines later it talks about
just the space characters which must be ignored.  How should that be
solved?  This is only related to spaces at the beginning or end of a
name part when old style quoting is not used.

* src/der-decoder.c:  

** should work on a stripped down parse tree

** Allow to specify the desired top element.
   Or a list so that it can detect the needed tree itself

* src/der-encoder.c
** Setting default values is missing
** Tags > 31 are not supported.

* src/asn1-*
** Cleanup the used data structures and remove unneeded functions.
** Think about a public API to the Asn functions.

* src/cms*
** split some stuff from cms.c into a new cms-build.c
** can't handle CRL infos in certificates
   This is not a problem within the Aegypten project as CRL aren't be
   retrieved by online means.
** cant't handle unprotected attributes
   e.g. for counter signatures.  Not needed in Aegypten.


* src/keyinfo.c
** Do we need to support BER encoded stuff?

* src/time.c
** Allow for other timezones

* src/reader.c
** ksba_reader_unread limited to 100 bytes
  Actually the reader is limited to 100 bytes over the first unread
  size.  Easy to fix.

* General
** The ASN.1 parse tree is not released in all places
** Some memory is not released in case of errors.

* src/crl.c
** certificateIssuer not supported
  To support this we need to have an extended ksba_crl_get_item
  function to either return the issuer or at least set a flag to
  indicate that such an extension is available. If this new API is
  used we will move detection of the critical certificateIssuer
  extension into the old ksba_crl_get_item and bail out only there.
  If the new version of that function is used there won't be a need to
  bail out.  Example of a CRL using this extension:
     http://pks.telesec.de/telesec/servlet/download_cr (2006-09-04).

** Allow fetching of all entry extensions.
