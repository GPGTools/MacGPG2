                            KSBA Overview
                            -------------

KSBA (pronounced Kasbah) is a library to make X.509 certificates as
well as the CMS easily accessible by other applications.  Both
specifications are building blocks of S/MIME and TLS.

In the first step we will concentrate on providing the profile
required by the Aegypten project (i.e. the MailTrusT based BSI profile
for SPHINX).  However, the architecture will be flexible enough to
easily support other profiles too.

KSBA will be made available as a standard shared library and reserves
identifiers starting with "ksba" and "_ksba" (also uppercase and mixed
case).  It does not rely on another cryptographic library but will
provide hooks for easy integration with Libgcrypt.



                            Documentation
                            -------------

A standard info format reference manual is included.  However the OCSP
feature has not yet been documented.  See the comments in src/ocsp.c
and the example tests/t-ocsp.c.  The package dirmngr make extensive
use of the ocsp feature and may be used as another example.
