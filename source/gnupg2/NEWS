 * Allow encryption with legacy Elgamal sign+encrypt keys with option
   --rfc2440.

 * Windows is now a supported platform.

 * Made sure that under Windows the file permissions of the socket are
   taken into account.  This required a change of our socket emulation
   code and changed the IPC protocol under Windows.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.7 (2007-09-10)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed encryption problem if duplicate certificates are in the
   keybox.

 * Made it work on Windows Vista.  Note that the entire Windows port

Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.3 (2007-03-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * By default, do not allow processing multiple plaintexts in a single
   stream.  Many programs that called GnuPG were assuming that GnuPG
   did not permit this, and were thus not using the plaintext boundary
   status tags that GnuPG provides.  This change makes GnuPG reject
   such messages by default which makes those programs safe again.
   --allow-multiple-messages returns to the old behavior. [CVE-2007-1263].

 * New --verify-option show-primary-uid-only. 

 * gpgconf may now reads a global configuration file to select which
   options are changeable by a frontend.  The new applygnupgdefaults

 * Fixed a serious and exploitable bug in processing encrypted
   packages. [CVE-2006-6235].

 * Added --passphrase-repeat to set the number of times GPG will
   prompt for a new passphrase to be repeated.  This is useful to help
   memorize a new passphrase.  The default is 1 repetition.

 * Using a PIN pad does now also work for the signing key.

 * A warning is displayed by gpg-agent if a new passphrase is too
   short.  New option --min-passphrase-len defaults to 8.

 * The status code BEGIN_SIGNING now shows the used hash algorithms.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.1 (2006-11-28)
------------------------------------------------

 * Experimental support for the PIN pads of the SPR 532 and the Kaan
   Advanced card readers.  Add "disable-keypad" scdaemon.conf if you
   don't want it.  Does currently only work for the OpenPGP card and
   its authentication and decrypt keys.

 * Fixed build problems on some some platforms and crashes on amd64.

 * Fixed a buffer overflow in gpg2. [bug#728,CVE-2006-6169]

 * GNU Pth is now a hard requirement.

 * [scdaemon] Support for OpenSC has been removed.  Instead a new and
   straightforward pkcs#15 modules has been written.  As of now it
   does allows only signing using TCOS cards but we are going to
   enhance it to match all the old capabilities.

 * [gpg-agent] New option --write-env-file and Assuan command
   UPDATESTARTUPTTY.

   related.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.3 (2003-12-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * New gpgsm options --{enable,disable}-ocsp to validate keys using
   OCSP. This option requires a not yet released DirMngr version.
   Default is disabled.

 * The --log-file option may now be used to print logs to a socket.
