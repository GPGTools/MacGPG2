The password for the p12 files is "password".

You may run the tests as usual with "make check" or after a plain make
in this directory you may run the tests individually.  When run in
this way they will print easy to parse output to stdout.  To run all
tests in this mode, use "make run-all-tests".  All test scripts create
a log file with the suffix ".log" appended to the test script's name.
