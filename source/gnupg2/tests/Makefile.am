# We used to run $(testscripts) here but these asschk scripts are not
# completely reliable in all enviromnets and thus we better disable

# write new tests based on gpg-connect-agent which has a full fledged
# script language and thus makes it far easier to write tests than to
# use the low--level asschk stuff.
