# This is an example for a pattern file as used by gpg-check-pattern.
# The file is line based with comment lines beginning on the *first*
# position with a '#'.  Empty lines and lines with just spaces are
# ignored.  The other lines may be verbatim patterns and match as they
# are (trailing spaces are ignored) or extended regular expressions
# indicated by a / in the first column and terminated by another / or
# end of line.  All comparisons are case insensitive.
 
# Reject the usual metavariables.  Usual not required because
# gpg-agent can be used to reject all passphrases shorter than 8
# charactes.

# As well as very common passwords.  Note that gpg-agent can be used
