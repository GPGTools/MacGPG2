@mansect description
@code{@gpgvname} is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

This program is actually a stripped-down version of @code{gpg} which is
only able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown
@code{gpg} and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that
the public keys used to make the signature are valid. There are
no configuration files and only a few options are implemented.

@code{@gpgvname} assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.
By default it uses a keyring named @file{trustedkeys.gpg} which is
assumed to be in the home directory as defined by GnuPG or set by an
option or an environment variable. An option may be used to specify
another keyring or even multiple keyrings.

@noindent
@mansect options
@code{@gpgvname} recognizes these options:

@table @gnupgtabopt

@item --verbose
@itemx -v
@opindex verbose
Gives more information during processing. If used
twice, the input data is listed in detail.

@item --quiet
@itemx -q
@opindex quiet
Try to be as quiet as possible.

@item --keyring @var{file}
@opindex keyring
Add @var{file} to the list of keyrings.
If @var{file} begins with a tilde and a slash, these
are replaced by the HOME directory. If the filename
does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).

@item --status-fd @var{n}
@opindex status-fd
Write special status strings to the file descriptor @var{n}.  See the
file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

@item --logger-fd @code{n}
@opindex logger-fd
Write log output to file descriptor @code{n} and not to stderr.

@item --ignore-time-conflict
@opindex ignore-time-conflict
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option turns these
checks into warnings.

@include opt-homedir.texi

@end table

@mansect return value

The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least
one signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

@mansect examples
@subsection Examples

@table @asis

@item @gpgvname @code{pgpfile}
@itemx @gpgvname @code{sigfile} [@code{datafile}]
Verify the signature of the file. The second form is used for detached
signatures, where @code{sigfile} is the detached signature (either
ASCII-armored or binary) and @code{datafile} contains the signed data;
if @code{datafile} is "-" the signed data is expected on
@code{stdin}; if @code{datafile} is not given the name of the file
holding the signed data is constructed by cutting off the extension
(".asc", ".sig" or ".sign") from @code{sigfile}.

@end table

@mansect environment
@subsection Environment

@table @asis

@item HOME
Used to locate the default home directory.

@item GNUPGHOME
If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

@table @asis

@item ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
