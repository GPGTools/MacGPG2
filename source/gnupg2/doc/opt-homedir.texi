@c This option is included at several places.
@item --homedir @var{dir}
@opindex homedir
Set the name of the home directory to @var{dir}. If this option is not
used, the home directory defaults to @file{~/.gnupg}.  It is only
recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
directory stated through the environment variable @env{GNUPGHOME} or
(on W32 systems) by means of the Registry entry
@var{HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir}.
