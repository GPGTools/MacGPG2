@mansect description
@ifset isman
GnuPG is a set of programs for public key encryption and digital
signatures.  The program most users will want to use is the OpenPGP
command line tool, named @command{gpg2}.  @command{gpgv}is a stripped
down version of @command{gpg2} with no encryption functionality, used
only to verify signatures against a trusted keyring.  @command{gpgsm} is
the X.509/CMS (for S/MIME) counterpart of
@command{gpg2}. @command{gpg-agent} is a passphrase and private key
daemon which may also emulate the @command{ssh-agent}.
