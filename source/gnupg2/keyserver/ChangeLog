	#include tweaks as FAKE_CURL is no longer meaningful.

2006-04-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	helper.  Add "check-cert" option to disable SSL certificate
	checking (which is on by default).

2005-01-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c: Fix typo.

2005-01-18  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c: s/MAX_PATH/URLMAX_PATH/g to avoid a clash with
	the W32 defined macro.  Removed unneeded initialization of static
	variables.
	* gpgkeys_http.c: Ditto.
	* ksutil.h: s/MAX_PATH/URLMAX_PATH/.

2005-01-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (main): Only allow specified protocols to use the
	curl handler.

	* Makefile.am: Use LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS instead of LIBCURL_INCLUDES.

2005-01-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ksutil.h, gpgkeys_curl.c, gpgkeys_hkp.c, gpgkeys_ldap.c,
	gpgkeys_finger.c, gpgkeys_http.c: Part 2 of the cleanup.  Move all
	the various defines to ksutil.h.

	* gpgkeys_finger.c, gpgkeys_hkp.c, gpgkeys_http.c, gpgkeys_ldap.c:
	Part 1 of a minor cleanup to use #defines instead of hard-coded
	sizes.

	* gpgkeys_finger.c (connect_server): Use INADDR_NONE instead of
	SOCKET_ERROR.  Noted by Timo.

2005-01-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (get_key): Newer versions of libcurl don't define
	TRUE.

2004-12-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (main): Use new defines for opting out of certain
	transfer protocols.  Allow setting HTTP proxy via "http-proxy=foo"
	option (there is natural support in libcurl for the http_proxy
	environment variable).

	* Makefile.am: Remove the conditional since this is all handled in
	autoconf now.

2004-12-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (main): New "follow-redirects" option.  Takes an
	optional numeric value for the maximum number of redirects to
	allow.  Defaults to 5.

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (main), gpgkeys_finger.c (main), gpgkeys_hkp.c
	(main), gpgkeys_http.c (main), gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Make sure
	that a "timeout" option passed with no arguments is properly
	handled.

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (get_key, writer): New function to wrap around
	fwrite to avoid DLL access problem on win32.

	* gpgkeys_http.c (main, get_key): Properly pass authentication
	info through to the http library.

	* Makefile.am: Build gpgkeys_http or gpgkeys_curl as needed.

	* gpgkeys_curl.c (main, get_key): Minor tweaks to work with either
	FTP or HTTP.

	* gpgkeys_ftp.c: renamed to gpgkeys_curl.c.

	* gpgkeys_ftp.c (main, get_key): Use auth data as passed by gpg.
	Use CURLOPT_FILE instead of CURLOPT_WRITEDATA (same option, but
	backwards compatible).

2004-12-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ftp.c: New.

	* Makefile.am: Build it if requested.

2004-12-14  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook, uninstall-hook): Removed.  For
	Windows reasons we can't use the symlink trick.

2004-12-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: The harmless "ignored error" on gpgkeys_ldap
	install on top of an existing install is bound to confuse people.
	Use ln -s -f to force the overwrite.

2004-10-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c [_WIN32] (connect_server): Fix typo.

2004-10-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am (other_libs): New.  Also include LIBICONV.  Noted by
	Tim Mooney.

2004-10-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am (other_libs): 

2004-10-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key, get_key, search_key): Use "hkp" instead
	of "x-hkp" so it can be used as a SRV tag.

2004-10-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c [_WIN32] (connect_server): Fix typo.

2004-10-15  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main, show_help): Kludge to implement standard
	GNU options. Factored help printing out.
	* gpgkeys_finger.c (main, show_help): Ditto.
	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main, show_help): Ditto.
	* gpgkeys_http.c (main, show_help): Ditto.
	* gpgkeys_test.in, gpgkeys_mailto.in: Implement --version and --help.

	* Makefile.am: Add ksutil.h.

2004-10-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c (main): We do not support relay fingering
	(i.e. "finger://relayhost/user@example.com"), but finger URLs are
	occasionally miswritten that way.  Give an error in this case.

2004-10-14  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c (get_key): s/unsigned char/byte/ due
	to a strange typedef for RISC OS.  Noted by Stefan.

2004-10-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main), gpgkeys_hkp.c (main), gpgkeys_http.c
	(main), gpgkeys_finger.c (main): Call timeout functions before
	performing an action that could block for a long time.

	* ksutil.h, ksutil.c: New.  Right now just contains timeout
	functions.

2004-10-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c, gpgkeys_hkp.c, gpgkeys_http.c, gpgkeys_ldap.c:
	Fix a few occurances of "filename" to `filename'.

2004-10-11  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgkeys_finger.c: New.

2004-08-27  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (search_key): Fix the prior faulty fix by
	introducing a cast but leaving skey unsigned.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (search_key): Change type of variable skey from
	unsigned char* to char* to fix type incompatibility.

2004-08-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key, search_key), gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key,
	search_key), gpgkeys_http.c (get_key): Do not give informational
	logs since this is now done inside gpg.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (dehtmlize): Understand the quote character
	(i.e. "&quot;") in HTML responses.
	(search_key): Search key must be unsigned for url encoder to work
	properly for 8-bit values.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Factor out informational display into
	new function build_info().

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (build_attrs): Properly terminate user ID strings
	that got shrunk due to encoding.

2004-08-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (find_basekeyspacedn): Use LDAP_SCOPE_BASE along
	with a full DN rather than LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL plus a filter to
	find the pgpServerInfo object.  Some LDAP setups don't like the
	search.
	(main): Stop binding to the server since it seems no server really
	requires it, and some require it not be there.

2004-07-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Add "debug" option.  This is only really
	useful with OpenLDAP, but it's practically vital to debug SSL and
	TLS setups.  Add "basedn" option.  This allows users to override
	the autodetection for base DN.  SSL overrides TLS, so TLS will not
	be started on SSL connections (starting an already started car).

2004-07-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (build_attrs): Add "pgpKeySize" and "pgpSubKeyID"
	attributes so we can do subkey searches.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Under certain error conditions, we might
	try and unbind twice.  Don't.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (join_two_modlists): New.
	(send_key): Use new function so we can try a modify operation
	first, and fail over to an add if that fails.  Add cannot cope
	with the NULLs at the head of the modify request, so we jump into
	the list in the middle.

2004-07-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Don't try and error out before making a
	ldaps connection to the NAI keyserver since we cannot tell if it
	is a NAI keyserver until we connect.  Fail if we cannot find a
	base keyspace DN.  Fix a false success message for TLS being
	enabled.

2004-07-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c [_WIN32]: Include Windows specific header files.
	Suggested by Brian Gladman.

2004-05-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_http.c: General polish and removal of leftover stuff
	from gpgkeys_hkp.c.

2004-05-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_http.c (get_key): Cosmetic fix - make sure that URLs
	with no path use a path of "/".

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (ldap2epochtime): We can always rely on timegm()
	being available now, since it's a replacement function.

2004-05-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_http.c: New program to do a simple HTTP file fetch using
	the keyserver interface.

	* Makefile.am: Build it.

2004-02-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Don't split LDADD across two lines since some make
	programs can't handle blank lines after a \ continuation.  Noted
	by Christoph Moench-Tegeder.

2004-02-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (send_key): List pgpCertID as one of the deleted
	attributes.  This guarantees that if something goes wrong, we
	won't be able to complete the transaction, thus leaving any key
	already existing on the server intact.

2004-02-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (delete_one_attr): Removed.
	(make_one_attr): Delete functionality added.  Optional deduping
	functionality added (currently only used for pgpSignerID).
	(build_attrs): Translate sig entries into pgpSignerID.  Properly
	build the timestamp for pgpKeyCreateTime and pgpKeyExpireTime.

2004-02-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (delete_one_attr): New function to replace
	attributes with NULL (a "delete" that works even for nonexistant
	attributes).
	(send_key): Use it here to remove attributes so a modify operation
	starts with a clean playing field.  Bias sends to modify before
	add, since (I suspect) people update their existing keys more
	often than they make and send new keys to the server.

2004-02-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (epoch2ldaptime): New.  Converse of
	ldap2epochtime.
	(make_one_attr): New. Build a modification list in memory to send
	to the LDAP server.
	(build_attrs): New. Parse INFO lines sent over by gpg.
	(free_mod_values): New.  Unwinds a modification list.
	(send_key_keyserver): Renamed from old send_key().
	(send_key): New function to send a key to a LDAP server.
	(main): Use send_key() for real LDAP servers, send_key_keyserver()
	otherwise.

2004-02-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Replacement prototypes for setenv and unsetenv.
	(search_key): Catch a SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED error and show the user
	whatever the server did give us.
	(find_basekeyspacedn): There is no guarantee that namingContexts
	will be readable.

	* Makefile.am: Link gpgkeys_ldap with libutil.a to get the
	replacement functions (and eventually translations, etc).

2004-02-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (ldap2epochtime): LDAP timestamps are UTC, so do
	not correct for timezones.
	(main): Find the basekeyspacedn before we try to start TLS, so we
	can give a better error message when a user tries to use TLS with
	a LDAP keyserver.

	* Makefile.am: Add automake conditionals to symlink gpgkeys_ldaps
	to gpgkeys_ldap when needed.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Add support for LDAPS and TLS
	connections.  These are only useful and usable when talking to
	real LDAP keyservers.  Add new "tls" option to tune TLS use from
	off, to try quietly, to try loudly, or to require TLS.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (find_basekeyspacedn): New function to figure out
	what kind of LDAP server we're talking to (either real LDAP or the
	LDAP keyserver), and return the baseKeySpaceDN to find keys under.
	(main): Call it from here, and remove the old code that only
	handled the LDAP keyserver.

2004-02-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (ldap_to_gpg_err): Make sure that
	LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER is defined before we use it.

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Fix VERSION number.

2004-01-13  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key): Add a content type.

2004-01-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (search_key): Catch a mangled input file (useful
	if something other than GnuPG is calling the program).
	(main): Avoid possible pre-string write.  Noted by Christian
	Biere.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Avoid possible pre-string write.

2003-12-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key, get_key, main): Work with new HTTP code
	that passes the proxy in from the outside.  If the command file
	sends a proxy, use it.  If it sends "http-proxy" with no
	arguments, use $http_proxy from the environment.  Suggested by
	Christian Biere.

2003-12-28  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c, gpgkeys_ldap.c [__riscos__]: Removal of
	unnecessary #ifdef __riscos__ sections.

2003-11-27  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key): Fixed invalid use of fprintf without
	format string.

2003-10-25  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* Makefile.am (gpgkeys_hkp_LDADD): Replaced INTLLIBS by LIBINTL.

2003-07-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use W32LIBS where appropriate.

2003-05-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c, gpgkeys_ldap.c: #include <getopt.h> if it is
	available.  Also include extern references for optarg and optind
	since there is no guarantee that any header file will include
	them.  Standards?  We don't need no stinkin' standards.

	* Makefile.am: Use @GETOPT@ to pull in libiberty on those
	platforms that need it.

2003-04-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (dehtmlize, parse_hkp_index): Fix memory
	corruption bug on some platforms.

2003-03-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key): Properly handle CRLF line endings in
	the armored key.
	(main): Accept "try-dns-srv" option.

	* Makefile.am: Use @CAPLIBS@ to link in -lcap if we are using
	capabilities.  Use @SRVLIBS@ to link in the resolver if we are
	using DNS SRV.

2003-02-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use a local copy of libexecdir along with @PACKAGE@
	so it can be easily overridden at make time.

2003-01-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Fix regexp to work properly if the "keyid" is
	not a keyid, but rather a text string from the user ID.

2003-01-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key): Use options=mr when getting a key so
	keyserver doesn't attach the HTML header which we will just have
	to discard.

2002-11-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main), gpgkeys_hkp.c (main): Use new keyserver
	protocol version.

2002-11-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): The deduping code requires
	"pgpcertid", but that was not available when running without
	verbose on.  Noted by Stefan.

2002-11-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Fix typo in deduping code.

2002-11-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (key_in_keylist, add_key_to_keylist,
	free_keylist, get_key, search_key): The LDAP keyserver doesn't
	remove duplicates, so remove them locally.  Do not include the key
	modification time in the search response.

2002-11-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key), gpgkeys_ldap.c (send_key): Properly
	handle an input file that does not include any key data at all.

2002-10-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main), gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): Add -V flag to
	output protocol and program version.

2002-10-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Anything linking with libutil.a needs INTLLIBS as
	well on platforms where INTLLIBS is set.

2002-10-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (write_quoted): Use %-encoding instead of
	\-encoding.
	(parse_hkp_index): Use new keyserver key listing format, and add
	support for disabled keys via include-disabled.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Don't print keysize unless it's >0.
	(printquoted): Use %-encoding instead of \-encoding.
	(search_key): Use new keyserver key listing format.

2002-10-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (search_key, main): Make sure LDAP values are
	freed in case of error.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (fail_all): New function to unwind a keylist and
	error each item.
	(main): Call fail_all from here, as needed.  Also add a NO_MEMORY
	error in an appropriate place and fix error return code.
	(ldap_err_to_gpg_err): Add KEYSERVER_UNREACHABLE.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (fail_all): New function to unwind a keylist and
	error each item.
	(main): Call fail_all from here.  Also add a NO_MEMORY error in an
	appropriate place.
	(get_key): Use new UNREACHABLE error for network errors.

2002-09-26  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (send_key): Removed non-constant initializers.

2002-09-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (ldap_err_to_gpg_err, ldap_to_gpg_err, send_key,
	get_key, search_key, main): Some minor error reporting
	enhancements for use with GPA (show reasons for KEY FAILED).

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key, get_key, search_key, main): Some minor
	error reporting enhancements for use with GPA (show reasons for
	KEY FAILED).

2002-09-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (handle_old_hkp_index): s/input/inp/ to avoid
	shadowing warning.

2002-09-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key, handle_old_hkp_index, search_key):
	Properly handle line truncation.

2002-09-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Add quasi-RFC-2368 mailto:email@addr?from=
	syntax so people can set their own email address to respond to.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key): Properly respond with KEY FAILED (to
	gpg) and "key not found" (to user) on failure.

2002-09-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c: (search_key, handle_old_hkp_index): Try and
	request a machine-readable key index.  If the server supports
	this, pass it through.  If the server does not support it, parse
	the "index" page.

2002-09-12  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c: Tidied up RISC OS initializations.

2002-09-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main): Remove warning - this is no longer
	experimental code.

2002-09-09  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key, get_key, search_key): Check return
	value of malloc.
	(dehtmlize): Use ascii_tolower to protect against weird locales.
	Cast the argument for isspace for the sake of broken HP/UXes.
	(search_key): Check return value of realloc.

2002-09-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Some compilers (RISC OS, HPUX c89)
	don't like using variables as array initializers.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (send_key): Use CRLF in headers.

2002-08-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Use same types on all
	platforms.  This was probably leftover from earlier code where the
	typing mattered.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c: Overall cleanup from iobuf conversion.  Be
	consistent in m_alloc and malloc usage.  Remove include-disabled
	(meaningless on HKP).  RISC OS tweak.

2002-08-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c, Makefile.am: Convert over to using iobufs.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (http_get, http_post): Use CRLF for line endings.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c: Include util.h on RISC OS as per Stefan.  Include
	a replacement for hstrerror() for those platforms (such as RISC
	OS) that don't have it.

2002-08-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: May as well include gpgkeys_hkp.c in the
	distribution now.  It works well enough without proxies, and isn't
	built by default.  It would be good to get some test experience
	with it.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main): Don't warn about include-subkeys - it
	isn't unsupported, it's actually non-meaningful in the context of
	HKP (yet).

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (parse_hkp_index, dehtmlize): Move HTML
	functionality into new "dehtmlize" function.  Remove HTML before
	trying to parse each line from the keyserver.  If the keyserver
	provides key type information in the listing, use it.  (Copy over
	from g10/hkp.c).

2002-08-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key, parse_hkp_index): Bring over latest code
	from g10/hkp.c.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Fix cosmetic URL display problem
	(extra ":" at the end).

2002-08-03  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Tidied up RISC OS initializations.

2002-07-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c: "Warning" -> "WARNING"

	* Makefile.am: Install keyserver helpers in @GNUPG_LIBEXECDIR@

2002-07-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (send_key, get_key, main): Consult the server
	version string to determine whether to use pgpKey or pgpKeyV2.

2002-07-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Use new OPAQUE tag for non net-path URIs.
	Fail more elegantly if there is no email address to send to.  Show
	the GnuPG version in the message body.

2002-07-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key), gpgkeys_hkp.c (get_key): Display
	keyserver URI as a URI, but only if verbose.

2002-07-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Error if the keyserver returns
	an unparseable HKP response.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main): Warn on honor-http-proxy,
	broken-http-proxy, and include-subkeys (not supported yet).

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main), gpgkeys_hkp.c (http_connect, main): Fix
	some shadowing warnings.

2002-06-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Don't hard-code the LDAP libraries - get them from
	LDAPLIBS via configure.  Also, gpgkeys_hkp is a program, not a
	script.

2002-06-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (include_subkeys): Default "include-subkeys" to
	off, since GnuPG now defaults it to on.

2002-06-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Type tweaks.

	* gpgkeys_hkp.c (main): Add experimental code warning.

2002-06-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, gpgkeys_hkp.c (new): Experimental HKP keyserver
	interface.

2002-05-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Include <lber.h> if we absolutely must.  This
	helps when compiling against a very old OpenLDAP.

2002-04-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Properly handle key requests in full
	fingerprint form.

2002-03-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (printquoted): Quote backslashes within keyserver
	search responses.

2002-02-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap (get_key): LDAP keyservers do not support v3
	fingerprints, so error out if someone tries.  Actually, they don't
	support any fingerprints, but at least we can calculate a keyid
	from a v4 fingerprint.

2002-02-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap: Clarify the notion of a partial failure.  This is
	possible if more than one key is being handled in a batch, and one
	fails while the other succeeds.  Note that a search that comes up
	with no results is not a failure - that is a valid response of "no
	answer".

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Allow GnuPG to send us full v4
	fingerprints, long key ids, or short key ids while fetching.
	Since the LDAP server doesn't actually handle fingerprints, chop
	them down to long key ids for actual use.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main, get_key): When searching for a keyid,
	search for subkeys as well as primary keys.  This is mostly
	significant when automatically fetching the key based on the id in
	a header (i.e. "signature made by....").  "no-include-subkeys"
	disables.

2002-02-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Fix compiler warning.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Be much more robust with mangled input files.

2001-12-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Use the new OUTOFBAND indicator so gpg knows
	not to try and import anything.  Also turn on perl -w for
	warnings.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): If we're using temp files (rather than
	stdin/stdout), make sure the file is closed when we're done.

2001-12-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Properly free the LDAP response when we're done with it.

	* Now that we handle multiple keys, we must remove duplicates as
	the LDAP keyserver returns keys with multiple user IDs multiple
	times.

	* Properly handle multiple keys with the same key ID (it's really
	rare, so fetch "0xDEADBEEF" to test this).

2001-12-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c, gpgkeys_mailto.in: Fix GNU capitalization
	issues.  Prefix log messages with "gpgkeys" to clarify which
	program is generating them.

2001-12-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (search_key): Use unsigned int rather than uint
	for portability.

2001-12-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Initial version of gpgkeys_ldap (LDAP keyserver helper) and
	gpgkeys_mailto (email keyserver helper)
