/* Same as fgets() but if the provided buffer is too short a larger
   one will be allocated.  This is similar to getline. A line is
   considered a byte stream ending in a LF.

   If MAX_LENGTH is not NULL, it shall point to a value with the
   maximum allowed allocation.  

   Returns the length of the line. EOF is indicated by a line of
   length zero. A truncated line is indicated by setting the value at
   MAX_LENGTH to 0.  If the returned value is less then 0 not enough
   memory was enable and ERRNO is set accordingly.

   If a line has been truncated, the file pointer is moved forward to
   the end of the line so that the next read starts with the next
   line.  Note that MAX_LENGTH must be re-initialzied in this case.

   Note: The returned buffer is allocated with enough extra space to
   append a CR,LF,Nul
