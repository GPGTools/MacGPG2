Common Lisp Support for libgpg-error
------------------------------------

Requirements:

ASDF	Packaging Support
CFFI	Foreign Function Interface

Use with:

> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op ':gpg-error)
> (use-package :gpg-error)


TODO
----

* We probably should define a condition base class.  Currently, we do
  this in the user code only (eg in GPGME).

* Some lispy convenience functions as need arises, for example for
  output.
