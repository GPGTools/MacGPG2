MacGPG2 2.0.19 - Release Notes
===============================

Features
--------

### Be automatically informed of new MacGPG2 versions

*   MacGPG2 keeps checking for new versions automatically and will
    tell you if one is available.

### No more nasty Keyserver errors

*   Uses the much more stable curl library to query keyservers instead of the
    curl wrapper included in gnupg, which is the default one if libcurl can't be found.

### Supports the legacy IDEA cipher

*   The patent of IDEA has expired in most countries and is now part of MacGPG2.
*   While it's possible to use IDEA for decrypting messages and files, it's not
    possible to use it to create new keys [#30](https://gpgtools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/66001/tickets/30-add-idea-support).
