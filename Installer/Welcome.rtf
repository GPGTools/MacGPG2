\f0\fs26 \cf0 Welcome to the MacGPG2 Installer. You will be guided through the necessary steps to install this software.\
\
This installer will only work with Mac OS X >=10.6.\
\

\b Please note that MacGPG2 does not install any user application as such so you won\'92t find any software in your programs folder. It installs the applications, including a native MacOSX pinentry program, which make encryption possible within other programs.
